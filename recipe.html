<h2>Recipes-World's Best Scrambled Eggs</h2>

<p>I adapted this recipe from a book called Sydney Food by Bill Granger.Ever since tasting these eggs on my 1st restaurant in Kings Cross.<br>
Sydney,I have been after the recipe I have since transformed it into what I really believe are the best scrambled eggs I have ever tasted. <br>
</p>
<p>This recipe is what I call a "Very special breakfast".just look at the ingredients to see why it has to be tasted to be believed.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p>The following Ingredients make one serving:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>1 tablespoon of butter(10g)</li>
<li>1/3 cup of cream (2,3/4 ounces)</li>
<li>A pinch of salt</li>
<li>Freshly miled black pepper</li>
<li>3 fresh chives(chopped)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<ol>
<li>Whisk,eggs,cream,and salt in a bowl</li>
<li>Melt butter in a non-stick pan over a high heat(taking care not to burn the butter)</li>
<li>Pour egg mixture into pan and wait until it starts setting around the edge of the pan(around 20 seconds)</li>
<li>Using a wooden spatula,bring the mixture into the center as if it were an omelet and let it cook for another 20 seconds.</li>
<li>Food contents in again,leave for 20 seconds,and repeat until the eggs are only just done.</li>
